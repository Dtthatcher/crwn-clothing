This was a follow along project from Udemy ZTM Complete React Developer Course in 2021

This full stack application utilizes React, Redux, Hooks, Firebase. 
The course also utilized GraphQL but was not implemented in this commit.

The main lessons I gained were in resuable components, and clean architecture.

Enjoy!
